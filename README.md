# Geolocation-Data-Intelligently
Cluster initially with a K-Means approach, before using a more complicated density-based algorithm, DBSCAN. 
Later evaluate these models, and offer improvements to DBSCAN with the introduction of HDBSCAN.

# The project includes:

  An introduction to the problem, as well as basic exploratory data analysis and visualizations
  Visualizing geographical data in a more meaningful and interactive way
  Methods of evaluating the strength of a clustering algorithm
  Theory behind K-Means, and how to use it for our problem
  Introduction to density-based clustering approaches, and how to use DBSCAN
  Introduction to HDBSCAN, to alleviate constraints of classical DBSCAN
  A simple method to address outliers classified by density-based models.
